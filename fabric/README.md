# AwakeAPI

AwakeAPI is a powerful Fabric mod that provides an API for allowing players to communicate with mobs in Minecraft using a Large Language Model (LLM). The AI-powered mobs can also interact with the world around them by executing custom commands that developers can write. This mod opens up new possibilities for dynamic interactions and complex behaviors in your Minecraft world.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Players can engage in conversations with mobs using natural language, powered by a Large Language Model.
- **LLM API Internally Handled**: The AwakeAPI comes with an in-game command to allow users to choose their own LLM API (OpenAI, Custom OAI-Like, and even support for locally running models such as Oobabooga), simplifying the workflow for developers.
- **Custom Commands**: Developers can define custom commands that mobs can execute, enabling AI interactions to affect the game world.
- **Flexible API**: A robust API for registering custom AI functions, managing conversations, and handling AI responses.
- **Server-Side Integration**: Utility functions for managing player data and AI interactions, optimized for server-side use.
- **Client-Side Privacy**: All information relating to a player's LLM API (such as the endpoint, model, and key), are all managed on the client-side.
- **Connected System**: Because of the differences with where the player's LLM API details are stored, AwakeAPI manages all access for you, the developer, allowing you to focus on integrating the features you want while it handles the sensitive parts.
